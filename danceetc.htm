                 <p>Thousands of dance students have been involved in dance projects for several years whilst dance lovers have been left on the side watching them perform.  Well its time for both these groups to get together and to question what DanceEtc is all about</p>


         <p>DanceEtc is all about the fringe elements that make dance what it is – can you get yourselves to understand that dance is not only about dance but involves so many other interesting subjects? Experts have been called in to give a series of lecture/demonstrations on various topics which are directly related to dance.  Even if you are slightly interested in dance you will find these sessions very interesting.  Needless to say, if you are passionate about dance then you cannot miss out on these meetings! </p>


Photographers, physiotherapist, nutritionists, psychologists, makeup artists, choreographers, artists and university lectures are amongst several guests who will be giving their time to help us  enrich our lives and to give us more holistic approach to dance.   We will be asking Malta’s finest experts to direct the session and their experience in the field will definitely make each session enjoyable and motivating.DanceEtc is open to anybody over the age of 13 who is interested in Dance.  The entrance fee to each session is €5.  Please contact us on thedanceworkshop@gmail.com for more information.

<img src="images/performances/etranter.jpg" vspace="1" hspace="5" align="left" valign="bottom"></b><p>DanceEtc has launched the first of its ‘dance related’ lectures at the premises of The Dance Workshop in G’Mangia.  Mr John Grech, who has now earned a reputation as being one of the Island’s leading dance photographers, delivered his lecture – Dance and the photgrapher -  to an enthusiastic audience.  The lecture started off with John introducing his work and his studies of dancers.  He then went on to describe the difficulties facing the photographer when trying to snap dancers in motion, namely that of trying to capture the movement in a still photo, given the constraints of speed of the dance and the available lighting in a performance .  John gave the audience various hints on how to capture imaginative images, which will not only report what is being seen, but give the interpretation of what the photographer wants to deliver.
In the second part of the lecture/workshop, four dancers were invited to perform a short dance and the participants, keeping all of John’s hints in mind, used their own cameras to try and capture highlights on camera.  John was able to discuss some of the shots and the techniques used during after the session.</a>
